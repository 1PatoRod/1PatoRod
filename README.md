# Hi! my name is Patricio Rodriguez

### Who am I?
I'm a fullStack programmer focused on front-end development.

I have always loved programming, since I was a child I loved to play with computers and understand how their applications work. I played programming and practicing such a profession, gradually turned the game into a dream and a goal to fulfill. I learned the basics of programming in the Java language, then continued with a more flexible language such as JavaScript, in which I currently develop, programming has helped me grow as a person and is a motivation for me to continue to making it.

### What do I do?

I carry out projects that allow me to advance in my training as a programmer, I look for solutions to the problems raised or that arise during development, correcting errors and improving the operation of the application, willing to learn about the technologies needed to continue with the project.

### Who should I contact?

My goal is to grow and make my mark in the world of programming.

I enjoy appreciating the different solutions to problems, finding it pleasing to learn some new way that I didn't know about, broadening my perspective on things even with problems I thought were already solved.

### What technologies do I use?

> JavaScript 
> React 
> Redux 
> Node.js 
> Sequelize 
> Express
